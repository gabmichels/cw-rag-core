# Source-Aware RAG Confidence Tracking System

## 🎯 Overview

The Source-Aware Confidence Tracking System is a revolutionary improvement to the RAG guardrail scoring that addresses the critical quality degradation issue where excellent vector search results (88.5% similarity) were being averaged with poor hybrid fusion scores (1.5%), leading to misleadingly low confidence ratings (27.4%).

## 🚨 Problem Statement

### The Quality Degradation Issue

**Before:** Traditional averaging approach
- Vector Search: 88.5% similarity (excellent!)
- RRF Fusion: 1.5% score (severely degraded by formula)
- Final Confidence: 27.4% (misleadingly low!)
- Result: High-quality queries blocked by guardrail

**Root Cause:** The RRF (Reciprocal Rank Fusion) formula `weight / (k + rank)` completely ignores original similarity scores, reducing an 88.5% vector match to just 1.15%.

## ✅ Solution: Multi-Stage Confidence Tracking

### Core Architecture

The new system tracks confidence at each pipeline stage and intelligently preserves high-quality signals:

```
┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│  Vector Search  │───▶│ Keyword Search  │───▶│  Fusion Stage   │───▶│   Reranking     │
│   88.5% conf   │    │   44.8% conf    │    │   1.0% conf     │    │   [optional]    │
│  ✅ Excellent   │    │  ✅ Moderate     │    │  🚨 Degraded    │    │                 │
└─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
                                                        │
                                                        ▼
                                               🧠 Quality Degradation
                                                    Detection
                                                        │
                                                        ▼
                                               🎯 Max-Confidence
                                                   Strategy
                                                        │
                                                        ▼
                                               ✨ Final: 88.4%
```

### Key Features

1. **Stage-Wise Confidence Tracking**: Each pipeline stage (vector→keyword→fusion→reranking) maintains its own confidence metrics
2. **Quality Degradation Detection**: Automatically detects when one stage significantly reduces quality
3. **Max-Confidence Principle**: Uses the highest-quality stage when degradation is detected
4. **Adaptive Weighting**: Adjusts weights based on per-stage quality preservation
5. **Detailed Explanations**: Provides clear reasoning for confidence decisions

## 🛠️ Implementation

### Core Service: `SourceAwareConfidenceService`

```typescript
import {
  SourceAwareConfidenceService,
  createSourceAwareConfidenceService
} from '@cw-rag-core/retrieval';

const confidenceService = createSourceAwareConfidenceService({
  degradationThreshold: 0.3,      // 30% degradation triggers alert
  maxConfidenceThreshold: 0.8,    // 80% confidence triggers max strategy
  enableDegradationAlerts: true
});

const result = confidenceService.calculateSourceAwareConfidence(
  vectorResults,
  keywordResults,
  fusionResults,
  rerankerResults
);
```

### Enhanced Guardrail Integration

The system seamlessly integrates with the existing `AnswerabilityGuardrailService`:

```typescript
// Automatically enabled in the enhanced guardrail service
const answerabilityScore = guardrailService.calculateAnswerabilityScore(
  hybridResults,
  rerankerResults
);

// Access source-aware details
console.log(answerabilityScore.sourceAwareConfidence.finalConfidence);
console.log(answerabilityScore.sourceAwareConfidence.degradationAlerts);
```

## 📊 Confidence Strategies

### 1. Max-Confidence Strategy
**When:** Any stage has >80% confidence AND degradation detected
**Logic:** Uses the highest confidence among all stages
**Use Case:** Preserve high-quality vector search results

### 2. Adaptive Weighted Strategy
**When:** Moderate confidence across stages, no severe degradation
**Logic:** Weight stages based on their quality preservation scores
**Use Case:** Balanced confidence when all stages perform reasonably

### 3. Conservative Strategy
**When:** All stages have low confidence (<30%)
**Logic:** Uses minimum confidence (most conservative)
**Use Case:** Fail-safe for genuinely poor quality results

## 🔍 Quality Degradation Detection

### Alert Types

```typescript
interface QualityDegradationAlert {
  stage: 'keyword' | 'fusion' | 'reranking';
  severity: number;              // 0-1, higher = worse
  description: string;
  recommendation: string;
  previousConfidence: number;
  currentConfidence: number;
}
```

### Example Alert

```
🚨 Alert: fusion stage
   Severity: 98.9%
   Description: Fusion stage reduced confidence by 98.9%
   Recommendation: Consider using max-confidence strategy or adjusting RRF parameters
   Quality Drop: 88.4% → 1.0%
```

## 📈 Performance Results

### Test Case: Real Quality Degradation Scenario

**Input:**
- Vector Search: 88.5% similarity (excellent quality)
- Keyword Search: 45% relevance (moderate quality)
- RRF Fusion: 1.5% score (severely degraded)

**Results:**

| Method | Confidence | Decision | Improvement |
|--------|------------|----------|-------------|
| Legacy Averaging | 44.7% | ❌ FAIL (50% threshold) | - |
| Source-Aware | 88.4% | ✅ PASS (50% threshold) | +43.7% |

- 50% threshold: Only source-aware passes ✅
- 70% threshold: Only source-aware passes ✅

## 🔧 Configuration Options

### Service Configuration

```typescript
interface SourceAwareConfidenceConfig {
  // Quality degradation detection threshold (0.3 = 30%)
  degradationThreshold: number;

  // Minimum confidence to trigger max-confidence strategy
  maxConfidenceThreshold: number;

  // Weights for adaptive weighted strategy
  adaptiveWeights: {
    vector: number;     // 0.4 (highest weight)
    keyword: number;    // 0.2
    fusion: number;     // 0.2
    reranking: number;  // 0.2
  };

  // Enable/disable degradation alerts
  enableDegradationAlerts: boolean;
}
```

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Guardrail threshold (works with source-aware confidence)
ANSWERABILITY_THRESHOLD=0.01  # Very permissive for testing
ANSWERABILITY_THRESHOLD=0.6   # Standard production value
```

- System reaches LLM synthesis stage
- Only fails on missing API key (expected)

## 📝 Stage Confidence Details

### Vector Stage Confidence
```typescript
{
  confidence: 88.4%,        // Direct from similarity scores
  quality: 88.4%,           // Same as confidence for vector search
  topScore: 88.5%,          // Best match found
  meanScore: 85.4%,         // Average across results
  resultCount: 10           // Number of vector results
}
```

### Fusion Stage Confidence
```typescript
{
  confidence: 1.0%,         // Low due to RRF formula
  quality: 10.0%,           // Quality preservation score
  topScore: 1.5%,           // Best fusion score
  meanScore: 1.4%,          // Average fusion score
  qualityPreservation: 0.1  // How much vector quality was preserved
}
```

## 🚀 Usage in Production

### Deployment Checklist

1. **✅ Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
