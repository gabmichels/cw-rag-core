## 📚 Documentation Principles

This documentation follows these principles:

- **Architecture over Operations**: Focus on design decisions and system understanding rather than step-by-step procedures
- **Conceptual Clarity**: Explain the "why" behind design decisions, not just the "what"
- **Code References**: Link to actual implementation where relevant
- **Visual Representation**: Use diagrams and visual aids to explain complex relationships
- **Future-Oriented**: Consider how the architecture supports growth and evolution

## 🔧 Contributing to Documentation

When updating this documentation:

1. **Keep architecture focus**: Document design intent, not implementation details
2. **Update cross-references**: Ensure links between documents remain valid
3. **Maintain consistency**: Follow the established structure and style
4. **Include code references**: Link to actual implementation using relative paths
5. **Consider the audience**: Write for developers who need to understand and extend the system
