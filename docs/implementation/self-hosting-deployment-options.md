# Self-Hosting Deployment Options

## Overview

Your multi-tenant implementation plan **already supports multiple deployment models** including self-hosting. The architecture is designed with excellent parameterization that makes it deployment-agnostic.

## Deployment Models Supported

### 1. **Shared Multi-Tenant Hosting** (Current Plan)
Multiple tenants on your infrastructure with isolation:

```bash
# Your infrastructure hosts multiple clients
./scripts/create-tenant.sh client-a --tier basic --api-port 3000
./scripts/create-tenant.sh client-b --tier premium --api-port 3100
./scripts/create-tenant.sh client-c --tier enterprise --api-port 3200
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Cost-effective for small clients
- ✅ Centralized management and updates
- ✅ Shared operational overhead
- ✅ Easy monitoring and support

### 2. **Single-Tenant Self-Hosted** (New Capability)
Dedicated client infrastructure with simplified deployment:

```bash
# Generate client package
./scripts/create-client-package.sh acme-corp --tier enterprise --single-tenant

# Client receives package and deploys
cd acme-corp-deployment
./scripts/deploy.sh
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Complete client control
- ✅ Data sovereignty
- ✅ Custom security policies
- ✅ No shared resource constraints

### 3. **Multi-Tenant Self-Hosted** (Advanced)
Client manages multiple internal tenants:

```bash
# Client runs their own multi-tenant setup
./scripts/create-client-package.sh enterprise-corp --tier enterprise
# Client gets full tenant management capability
```

**Use Cases:**
- Large organizations with multiple departments
- Consultancies serving multiple clients
- Educational institutions with multiple schools

### 4. **Hybrid Deployment**
Mix of shared and dedicated:

```yaml
# Your shared infrastructure
shared_tenants: [startup-a, startup-b, nonprofit-c]

# Dedicated self-hosted
dedicated_clients:
  - enterprise-corp: dedicated-server-1
  - government-agency: air-gapped-environment
  - healthcare-provider: hipaa-compliant-cloud
```

## Architecture Analysis

### ✅ Self-Hosting Ready Features

Your current [`docker-compose.yml`](../docker-compose.yml) is already optimized for self-hosting:

1. **Environment Variable Parameterization**
   ```yaml
   container_name: ${PROJECT_PREFIX:-cw-rag}-${TENANT:-zenithfall}-api
   ports: "${API_PORT:-3000}:3000"
   volumes: ${PROJECT_PREFIX:-cw_rag}_${TENANT:-zenithfall}_embeddings_cache
   ```

2. **Flexible Configuration**
   ```env
   TENANT=client-name
   PROJECT_PREFIX=client-rag
   API_PORT=3000  # No conflicts in dedicated environment
   ```

3. **Service Independence**
   - Each service can run independently
   - No hardcoded dependencies on shared infrastructure
   - Health checks ensure proper startup order

4. **Data Isolation**
   - Named volumes with tenant prefixes
   - Separate networks per deployment
   - Container-level isolation

## Self-Hosting Implementation

### Quick Start for Clients

1. **Generate Deployment Package**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/create-client-package.sh client-name --tier enterprise --single-tenant
   ```

2. **Package Contents**
   ```
   client-name-deployment/
   ├── docker-compose.yml      # Simplified, no tenant variables
   ├── .env                    # Pre-configured for single tenant
   ├── scripts/
   │   ├── deploy.sh          # One-command deployment
   │   ├── stop.sh            # Clean shutdown
   │   ├── backup.sh          # Data backup
   │   └── update.sh          # System updates
   ├── docs/
   │   └── README.md          # Client-specific documentation
   └── package-info.json      # Deployment metadata
   ```

3. **Client Deployment**
   ```bash
   # Client receives package and deploys
   tar -xzf client-deployment.tar.gz
   cd client-deployment

   # Configure environment
   nano .env  # Add OpenAI API key, adjust settings

   # Deploy with one command
   ./scripts/deploy.sh

   # Access at http://localhost:3001
   ```

### Configuration Simplification for Self-Hosting

#### Single-Tenant `.env` (No Variables)
```env
# Simplified for dedicated environment
TENANT=client-name
PROJECT_PREFIX=client-rag
INSTANCE_NAME=production

# Standard ports (no conflicts)
API_PORT=3000
WEB_PORT=3001
QDRANT_PORT=6333

# Client-specific settings
INGEST_TOKEN=client-secure-token-2024
OPENAI_API_KEY=client-openai-key

# No tenant isolation variables needed
# No port conflict resolution needed
# No multi-tenant complexity
```

#### Simplified `docker-compose.yml`
```yaml
services:
  api:
    container_name: client-rag-client-name-api  # Hardcoded
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"  # No variable substitution
    environment:
      - TENANT=client-name  # Hardcoded
```

## Self-Hosting Benefits

### For Clients
- ✅ **Data Sovereignty**: Complete control over data location and access
- ✅ **Custom Security**: Implement organization-specific security policies
- ✅ **Performance**: Dedicated resources, no noisy neighbors
- ✅ **Compliance**: Meet regulatory requirements (HIPAA, GDPR, etc.)
- ✅ **Customization**: Modify configuration for specific needs

### For You (Service Provider)
- ✅ **Scalable Business Model**: Serve enterprise clients who require self-hosting
- ✅ **Reduced Infrastructure Costs**: Client pays for their own hosting
- ✅ **Market Expansion**: Reach security-conscious enterprises
- ✅ **Support Revenue**: Ongoing support and maintenance contracts

## Deployment Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Enterprise Self-Hosting
```bash
# Enterprise client wants dedicated deployment
./scripts/create-client-package.sh fortune500-corp --tier enterprise --single-tenant

# They deploy on their infrastructure:
# - AWS/Azure/GCP with their accounts
# - On-premises servers
# - Air-gapped environments
# - HIPAA/SOC2 compliant environments
```

### Scenario 2: Consultant Multi-Tenant
```bash
# Consulting firm wants to serve multiple clients
./scripts/create-client-package.sh consulting-firm --tier premium

# They manage multiple tenants:
consulting-firm/create-tenant.sh client-a --tier basic
consulting-firm/create-tenant.sh client-b --tier premium
```

### Scenario 3: Hybrid Model
```bash
# Small clients on your shared infrastructure
./scripts/create-tenant.sh startup-a --tier basic --api-port 3000
./scripts/create-tenant.sh startup-b --tier basic --api-port 3100

# Enterprise clients self-hosted
./scripts/create-client-package.sh enterprise-c --tier enterprise --single-tenant
./scripts/create-client-package.sh government-d --tier enterprise --single-tenant
```
