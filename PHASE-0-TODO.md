# PHASE-0 TODO: Implementation Roadmap and Critical Gaps

This document outlines the critical gaps, outstanding issues, and a phased implementation roadmap for completing Phase-0, enabling the system for initial production deployment.

## 1. Executive Summary

Phase-0 focuses on establishing a minimal viable RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system with robust ingestion, embedding, and vector search capabilities. Critical gaps currently prevent production deployment, primarily revolving around placeholder implementations for core services and misconfigurations. Addressing these issues will unlock the foundational functionality required for the system.

## 2. Critical Issues (🔴 Production Blockers)

These issues must be resolved before any production deployment can be considered.

-   **🔴 Stub Embedding Service:** The embedding service currently contains stubbed functionality and does not integrate with a real embedding model.
    -   **File Reference:** [`packages/retrieval/src/embedding.ts`](packages/retrieval/src/embedding.ts)
    -   **Actionable Suggestion:** Replace placeholder embedding logic with actual API calls to a chosen embedding model (e.g., OpenAI, Cohere, local OSS model).
    -   **Effort Estimate:** High (3-5 days)
-   **🔴 Vector Dimension Mismatch:** Discrepancy between configured vector dimensions (constants) and the actual implementation in the Qdrant service. This leads to ingestion failures.
    -   **File Reference:** Needs codebase search to identify constants file. Likely in `packages/shared/src/constants.ts` and `apps/api/src/services/qdrant.ts` or `packages/retrieval/src/qdrant.ts`.
    -   **Actionable Suggestion:** Standardize vector dimensions across all configurations and implementations, ensuring the Qdrant collection is initialized with the correct size.
    -   **Effort Estimate:** Medium (1-2 days)
-   **🔴 Mock Vector Search in Qdrant Service:** The Qdrant service uses mock data or a simplified search logic instead of performing actual vector similarity search against the Qdrant instance.
    -   **File Reference:** `packages/retrieval/src/qdrant.ts` or `apps/api/src/services/qdrant.ts`
    -   **Actionable Suggestion:** Implement actual vector search queries using the Qdrant client, integrating with the embedding service output.
    -   **Effort Estimate:** High (2-4 days)
-   **🔴 Missing Authentication Token Configuration:** The system lacks proper configuration and validation for authentication tokens, making API endpoints insecure.
    -   **File Reference:** `apps/api/src/middleware/auth.ts`
    -   **Actionable Suggestion:** Implement robust token validation, integrate with environment variables for secret management, and enforce authentication on protected routes.
    -   **Effort Estimate:** Medium (2-3 days)

## 3. High Priority Issues (🟡 Major Functionality Gaps)

These issues are critical for core functionality but may not be strict blockers for a minimal production go-live if adequately mitigated or phased.

-   **🟡 Stub Answer Generation in Ask Endpoint:** The `/api/ask` endpoint provides stubbed or generic answers instead of generating contextually relevant responses using the retrieved documents.
    -   **File Reference:** `apps/api/src/routes/ask.ts`
    -   **Actionable Suggestion:** Integrate with an LLM (Large Language Model) to synthesize answers based on the retrieved vector search results and the user's query.
    -   **Effort Estimate:** High (3-5 days)
-   **🟡 Incomplete File Processing for PDF/DOCX:** The ingestion pipeline has limited or incomplete processing capabilities for PDF and DOCX file types, preventing proper text extraction and chunking.
    -   **File Reference:** Likely in `apps/api/src/utils/document.ts` or ingestion related routes.
    -   **Actionable Suggestion:** Enhance or integrate external libraries for robust PDF/DOCX parsing and text extraction, ensuring consistent document processing.
    -   **Effort Estimate:** High (4-6 days)
-   **🟡 Missing Docker Environment Variables:** Essential environment variables required for Docker deployments (e.g., API keys, database connection strings, Qdrant credentials) are not fully defined or properly injected.
    -   **File Reference:** `ops/compose/docker-compose.yml`, `.env.example`, Dockerfiles (e.g., `apps/api/Dockerfile`, `apps/web/Dockerfile`)
    -   **Actionable Suggestion:** Document all required environment variables and ensure they are correctly set up in Docker compose files and application configurations.
    -   **Effort Estimate:** Medium (1-2 days)
-   **🟡 Web App API Integration Issues:** The web application currently has known issues or incomplete integration with the backend API, affecting data display or submission.
    -   **File Reference:** `apps/web/src/utils/api.ts`, web app components (e.g., `apps/web/src/app/ingests/page.tsx`, `apps/web/src/app/upload/page.tsx`)
    -   **Actionable Suggestion:** Debug and complete the API integrations in the frontend, ensuring all data flows correctly between the web app and the backend.
    -   **Effort Estimate:** Medium (2-3 days)

## 4. Medium/Low Priority Issues (🟠🟢 Performance & UX Improvements)

These issues are important for system robustness, user experience, and long-term maintainability but are not immediate blockers for Phase-0.

-   **🟠 Limited Test Coverage Gaps:** Certain critical modules or edge cases lack sufficient unit, integration, or end-to-end tests.
    -   **File Reference:** All `src/__tests__/` directories, e.g., `apps/api/src/__tests__/ask.test.ts`
    -   **Actionable Suggestion:** Identify and implement additional tests to improve overall code quality and prevent regressions, especially for core logic.
    -   **Effort Estimate:** Medium (3-5 days, ongoing)
-   **🟠 n8n Workflow Validation Needs:** Existing n8n workflows lack comprehensive validation and error handling, potentially leading to silent failures.
    -   **File Reference:** `n8n/workflows/ingest-baseline.json`, `n8n/workflows/obsidian-sync.json`, `n8n/workflows/postgres-sync.json`
    -   **Actionable Suggestion:** Enhance n8n workflows with error handling, logging, and data validation steps.
    -   **Effort Estimate:** Medium (2-3 days)
-   **🟢 Performance Optimization Opportunities:** Initial performance analysis indicates areas for improvement in data processing, querying, or API response times.
    -   **File Reference:** `test-performance.js`, `apps/api/src/server.ts`, `packages/retrieval/src/embedding.ts`, `packages/retrieval/src/qdrant.ts`
    -   **Actionable Suggestion:** Profile critical paths and implement optimizations such as batch processing, caching, or more efficient algorithms.
    -   **Effort Estimate:** Low/Medium (2-4 days, ongoing)
-   **🟢 Documentation Inconsistencies:** Some documentation (e.g., `docs/README.md`, `PHASE-1-TODO.md`, `RUNBOOK-ingestion.md`) may be outdated, incomplete, or inconsistent with the current codebase.
    -   **File Reference:** `docs/`, `README.md`, `PHASE-1-TODO.md`, `RUNBOOK-ingestion.md`
    -   **Actionable Suggestion:** Review and update all relevant documentation to reflect the current state of the system and best practices.
    -   **Effort Estimate:** Low (1-2 days, ongoing)
